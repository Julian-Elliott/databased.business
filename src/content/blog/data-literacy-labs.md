The most common request I receive from partners is help designing data literacy programmes that actually change behaviour. The
pattern that works best looks less like a lecture and more like a lab. Here's the structure we now use when launching a new
series inside a department.

1. **Scenario briefs replace slide decks.** Each session starts with a prompt grounded in the team's own metricsâ€”think service
   backlog numbers or public satisfaction scores. Participants work in pairs to explore the data before we introduce any theory.
2. **Tooling is purposefully constrained.** Instead of teaching a different platform each week, we stick to one analysis surface
   and one storytelling format. People gain confidence because they see their progress from session to session.
3. **Feedback loops are designed-in.** Every lab ends with a "commitment card" where participants note what they will try next
   and what help they need. We review those cards during the following session to close the loop.
4. **Leaders show up.** When senior stakeholders attend as learners, not judges, teams feel safe experimenting. We schedule office
   hours with them to unblock adoption issues quickly.

After six weeks we have a library of reusable scenarios, a cohort of champions who can mentor others, and clear signals about
where the data platform or governance model needs to improve. Literacy becomes a capability the organisation maintains rather
than a one-off training event.
