When people hear "data governance" they imagine the brakes being slammed on their projects. During interviews with civic
technology teams I repeatedly heard that compliance felt like a parallel universeâ€”important on paper, rarely aligned with the
real work. Democratisation depends on governance that is both legible and kind, so I have been prototyping a more generous
approach.

The cornerstone is **decision logging**. Every time a schema, retention policy, or access rule changes we capture the "why" in a
shared notebook. That notebook is searchable, linkable from dashboards, and reviewed during onboarding. Instead of lore being
carried in hallway conversations, it becomes a public record of trade-offs that new teammates can interrogate.

We pair the log with **graduated access tiers**. Rather than a binary public/private switch, contributors choose from levels such
as "exploratory", "team production", and "cross-organisation" when publishing datasets. Each tier comes with a checklist of
expected safeguards and reviewer roles. Sensitive work is still protected, but innovators are no longer blocked from sharing
scrappy prototypes with collaborators.

Finally, we measure governance through the lens of service design. Are the templates easy to understand? Do people know who to
ask for help? Are decisions reversed when evidence changes? By treating governance as an experience to be designed, we unlock
more responsible participation without creating another bureaucratic maze.
