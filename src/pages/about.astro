		Hello, I am Julian, an inquisitive individual with a passion for transforming data into insights. After fourteen years in the retail sector, I transitioned from automation to data analytics to pursue what truly motivates me: solving complex problems and uncovering the narratives within data.
	</p>

	<p>
		My background encompasses application operations, networking, and data governance, with a solid technical foundation in Python, SQL, and scripting. At John Lewis, I led robotic process automation initiatives, integrating systems and enhancing efficiency across departments. Currently, I am delving deeper into data by undertaking an MSc in Data Analytics to refine my skills for the future.

	<p>
		Beyond work, I am captivated by cultural influences, enjoy strategic games such as poker and mahjong, and experiment with technology and automation tools. I take pleasure in finding elegant solutions to intricate problems and believe in continuous learning, simplicity, and precision.
	</p>

	<p>
		This blog is my platform to share thoughts, experiments, and insights from the realms of data, automation, and technology, with occasional references to science fiction or gaming. If you share this curiosity, stay tuned. There is always something new to explore.
