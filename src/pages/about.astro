		Hi, I’m Julian — a curious mind with a passion for turning data into insight. After 14 years in the retail sector, I transitioned from automation to data analytics to follow what really drives me: solving complex problems and uncovering the stories data can tell.
	</p>

	<p>
		My background spans application operations, networking, and data governance, with a strong technical foundation in Python, SQL, and scripting. At John Lewis, I led robotic process automation efforts, integrating systems and improving efficiency across departments. Now, I’m diving deeper into data — pursuing an MSc in Data Analytics to sharpen my skills for the future.

		Outside of work, I’m fascinated by cultural influences, play strategic games like Civ5 and mahjong, and tinker with tech and automation tools. I enjoy finding elegant solutions to messy problems and believe in continuous learning, simplicity, and getting things right the first time.
	</p>

	<p>
		This blog is where I share thoughts, experiments, and insights from the world of data, automation, and tech — with the occasional sci-fi or gaming reference thrown in. If you’re curious too, stick around. There's always something new to explore.
