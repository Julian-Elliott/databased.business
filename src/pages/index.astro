			<h1>📊 Welcome to databased.business</h1>
			<p>
				We believe data shouldn't be locked away behind technical jargon or tools only analysts understand.
				Our mission is to make data analysis transparent, approachable, and actionable — even for those who don't speak SQL or Python.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whether you're a curious team member, a small business owner, or someone tired of spreadsheets with no answers, databased.business aims to deliver intuitive insights through modern tools that empower everyone.
			</p>
			<p>
				We're building:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>🧠 Smart dashboards that explain the "why" behind the data</li>
				<li>🔎 Easy-to-use interfaces for exploring trends and patterns</li>
				<li>🛠️ Tools that reduce the gap between raw data and real decisions</li>
				<li>📚 Content that teaches, not preaches — making you confident with data</li>
			</ul>
