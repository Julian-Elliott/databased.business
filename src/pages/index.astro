      <h1>Data, based in reality</h1>

      <p>
        databased.business is my studio for translating graduate-level research into tools that
        operations teams can actually use. It is a promise to stay grounded in outcomes, not
        dashboards for dashboards' sake.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm Julian Elliott, currently undertaking an <strong>MSc in Data Analytics</strong> at the
        University of Huddersfield. My work interrogates how human-centred automation, robust data
        governance, and accessible analytics can unlock compounding value inside real businesses.
      </p>

      <h2>Grounded MSc research</h2>
      <p>
        The projects featured here are rooted in the questions driving my dissertation and applied
        research practice:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Optimising logistics and supply chains with streaming analytics that highlight wasted
          miles before they compound.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bringing large language models into business intelligence workflows without sacrificing
          trust, transparency, or explainability.
        </li>
        <li>
          Designing governance frameworks that let non-technical teams explore data safely and make
          confident decisions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What to expect</h2>
      <p>Upcoming posts will blend research, experimentation, and real-world application:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Research briefs that distil MSc findings into playbooks for analysts, operators, and
          domain experts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hands-on walkthroughs from my homelab, covering automation stacks like n8n, containerised
          services, and data ops pipelines.
        </li>
        <li>
          Field notes on prototypes—dashboards, agents, and decision support tools—tested with
          actual business scenarios.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Let's collaborate</h2>
      <p>
        Have a challenge that needs clearer data, faster insight, or a fresh automation idea?
        Let's talk and see how we can build something grounded together.
