# databased.business

_databased.business_ is my home on the web for exploring "data democratisation", the core theme of my MSc dissertation. Rather than repeating dissertation chapters, this site serves as a parallel resource where I translate academic learning into original essays, lab notes, and experiments for a wider community. Expect reflections that bridge theory with pragmatic approaches to building data-informed organisations while respecting the integrity of the submitted research.

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and deployed on [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) Workers and Pages to keep delivery fast and resilient. Along the way I rely on TypeScript, modern CSS tooling, and a small collection of data visualisation libraries to prototype concepts quickly.

## Current Goals

- Publish foundational essays that interpret the dissertation research questions without duplicating the formal submission.
- Document the technical stack, deployment workflow, and repeatable project structure.
- Share experiments that put data storytelling patterns into practice.
- Invite feedback that sharpens the narrative around equitable access to data.

## Planned Features and Content Areas

- A living literature review summarising key authors, frameworks, and case studies on data democratisation.
- Hands-on tutorials showing how to build lightweight data products with open-source tools.
- Interactive prototypes that blend dashboards, notebooks, and narrative to illustrate end-to-end insights.
- Reflections on ethics, governance, and cultural change required to make data accessible.

## Follow Along and Contribute

This repository tracks the full Astro project, so you can clone it, run `npm install`, and use `npm run dev` to explore the site locally. Issues and discussions are welcome, whether you want to point me towards new research, share real-world stories, or suggest improvements to the build. Feel free to open a pull request, or reach out via [email](mailto:Julian@databased.business) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/databased.business) to stay in touch as the project evolves.
